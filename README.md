Honey Lens: Symbolic Coherence Runtime
This repository contains the core runtime scripts, example inputs, and minimal supporting data for the Honey Lens symbolic coherence system.
It implements the BIOS–Kernel lone pair architecture, Waveform Table of Elements synthesis runtime, and coherence-scoring tools described in our Zenodo publication: DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16789649.
For the complete package—including all derivation papers, extended datasets, and large-scale simulation outputs—please see the linked Zenodo record.

Features:

Symbolic BIOS + Kernel runtime

Waveform synthesis & coherence scoring

Scalar playback & field modeling tools

Modular, extensible architecture for research and applied use

Getting Started:

Clone this repo.

Install dependencies from requirements.txt.

Run waveform_runtime.py for synthesis calculations or scalar_playback.py for playback modeling.
