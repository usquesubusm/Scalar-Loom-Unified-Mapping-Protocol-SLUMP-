# Lab Briefs — Novel Candidates (Summary)

Provide: inputs, route, targets, measurements, pass/fail.

## Be/Graphene nano-laminate

* Route: stack \& hot-roll; barrier; PPE for Be.
* Targets: intact interfaces; low contact resistance.
* Pass: peel strength > X N/m; Rs decrease ≥ Y% vs baseline.

## Mg–Graphene thin-film

* Route: co-sputter + cap; anneal.
* Targets: continuous film; Rs ≤ Z Ω/sq.
* Pass: stable Rs (±10%) after 10 thermal cycles.

## P–Graphene heterolayer

* Route: exfoliate/transfer under inert; encapsulate.
* Targets: clean interface; PL/Raman signature shift.
* Pass: no oxidation peaks in XPS after 48 h.

## Ti–C–Graphene cermet

* Route: powder + hot press.
* Targets: density ≥ 95% theoretical; K\_IC improvement vs TiC.
* Pass: hardness ≥ H0 and K\_IC ≥ K0 thresholds.
