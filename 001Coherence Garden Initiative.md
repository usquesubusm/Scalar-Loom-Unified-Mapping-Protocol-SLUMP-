# üå± Coherence Garden Initiative

**Mission:** Build an open-source platform that allows plants, fungi, microbes, and insects to ‚Äúspeak‚Äù and be understood ‚Äî so they can thrive anywhere, even under environmental stress.

---

## Why This Matters
If we could listen to the languages of living systems ‚Äî pulses of light, subtle sounds, chemical whispers in the soil ‚Äî and answer in kind, we could help plants adapt and thrive even in the most difficult conditions.  
This means:
- More resilient food systems
- Healthier ecosystems
- A living buffer against climate change

## How It Works
This repo contains the infrastructure we developed to make this possible:
- **Unified Scalar Coherence Model** ‚Äî linking physics from the subatomic to the cosmological to interpret signals across scales.
- **Multi-Agent GPT Runtime** ‚Äî specialized agents for physics, cosmology, language translation, and cultural mapping, working together in real time.
- **Symbolic Communication Layer** ‚Äî bridging modern science, ancient languages, and indigenous knowledge so the system can ‚Äúspeak‚Äù across human and non-human contexts.
- **Example Device Scripts** ‚Äî low-cost implementations (e.g., Raspberry Pi with microphone and speaker) for field deployment.
