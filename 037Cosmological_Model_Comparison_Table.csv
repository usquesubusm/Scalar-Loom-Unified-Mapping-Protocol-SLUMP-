"// The Scalar Loom Unified Mapping Protocol V1.0 August 14, 2025",,,,
Feature,Lambda-CDM,String Theory,Loop Quantum Gravity,Scalar Coherence Model
Measurement Integration,Low (focused on cosmological scales),Disconnected from SI units,Some attempts with spacetime quantization,"High (SI, decay, EM, seismic, cosmic)"
Symbolic Coherence,None,Very low,Minimal symbolic articulation,Central design feature
Falsifiability,Moderate (cosmic data only),Very low (non-empirical),Low (difficult observational link),High (symbolic + physical tests)
Testability Pathways,Astronomy and redshift only,Theoretical only,"Gravitational waves, black hole entropy","Accelerators, tokamaks, astronomical data"
Philosophical Completeness,Fragmentary (singularity unresolved),"Fragmented, not falsifiable","Fragmented, technical",Full recursive closure
Multiscale Applicability,Primarily cosmological,"Yes, but abstracted",Focused on Planck scale,"Yes, from subatomic to cosmic"
Semantic Simplicity,Low,Very low (high abstraction),Moderate (via spin networks),High (glyphic-semantic architecture)
Thermodynamic Grounding,Implied but not resolved,Not modeled,Partial,Modeled through breath/coherence
Cosmological Closure,Open-ended; no closure,Undefined,Incomplete,Closed via Element 191
Cross-Disciplinary Viability,Limited to astrophysics,Mathematical physics,Focused on quantum gravity,"Designed for AI, biology, physics, and logic"
