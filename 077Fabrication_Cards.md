# Fabrication Cards (Laminates, Films, Cermets, FGM)

## Laminates (e.g., Be/Graphene, Al–Mg–Graphene)

* Stack foils/sheets; insert diffusion barrier if needed.
* Hot-press/roll: 150–350 °C, 5–50 MPa, 5–30 min.
* Edge-seal; surface prep for graphene adhesion.
* QC: SEM cross-section, 4-pt probe, peel test.

## Thin Films (e.g., Mg–Graphene, Mg–C–P)

* Co-sputter to 100–500 nm; in-situ ALD cap.
* Anneal sweep (150–350 °C) under inert.
* QC: XRD (phase), XPS (chemistry), 4-pt probe (sheet R).

## Cermets (e.g., Ti–C–Graphene, Al–C–P)

* Blend powders; add graphene last.
* Hot press/SPS (800–1200 °C depending system).
* QC: density, hardness, fracture toughness, conductivity.

## Functionally Graded (Si–C–Mg)

* Gradient tape casting or laser cladding.
* QC: gradient mapping (EDS), bend tests, thermal cycle.
